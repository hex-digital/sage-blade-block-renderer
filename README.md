The Blade Block Renderer for Sage allows the easy registration of blade partials for the render function
of native Gutenberg blocks. Useful when you want to edit a block in React, but render with Blade.

## Features

- ðŸ”¥ Use all your blade components and PHP functions immediately in your native Gutenberg blocks. 
- ðŸ”¥ Instantly generate a working render_callback, powered by Blade with a native Sage 10 feel for passing view data.
- ðŸ”¥ All blocks support `InnerBlocks` content

## Requirements

- [Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) >= 10.0

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
$ composer require hex-digital/sage-blade-block-renderer
```

## Usage

### Rendering a Block with a blade-powered render callback

To create your first rendered block, start by running the following generator command from your theme directory:

```bash
$ wp acorn blade-block:block Example
```

This will create `app/BladeBlocks/Example.php` which is where you will create and manage your first blade block.

Take a look at it once created. You'll see it has a familiar `with()` function for passing data to your block. 

An `View` is also generated in the `resources/views/blocks` directory. Feel free to check that now too.

#### Block Preview View

While `$block->preview` is an option for conditionally modifying your block when shown in the editor, you may also render your block using a seperate view.

Simply duplicate your existing view prefixing it with `preview-` (e.g. `preview-example.blade.php`).
